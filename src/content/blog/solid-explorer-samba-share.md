> I used **Android 12** when making the guide, the steps to make this work may be different if you're using an older version of Android. (But most likely will be the same or similar.) As of 2025, I can confirm this process is still identical on **Android 14**.

## About Solid Explorer

<a href="https://neatbytes.com/solidexplorer" target="_blank" umami-event-data="solid-explorer-site">Solid Explorer by Neatbytes</a> is a powerful, easy to use file manager for Android devices lets you connect to cloud storage and network folders including (among others) Google Drive, Dropbox, S/FTP, and for our purposes, SMB shares. By connecting an SMB share to Solid Explorer, you can easily interact with server files using a slick GUI and transfer files between server and device. Solid Explorer can be <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.solidexplorer2" target="_blank" umami-event-data="solid-explorer-gplay">downloaded from the Google Play Store for free</a>.

## Connect Solid Explorer to SMB share

First, make sure you're on the same Wi-Fi network as the SMB share you want to access in Solid Explorer. (Setting this up to be available from outside the home network is possible, but beyond the scope of this article. But <a href="/blog/comprehensive-guide-tailscale-securely-access-home-network/" target="_blank" data-umami-event="solid-explorer-tailscale">this might interest you</a>.)

Open the Solid Explorer app and tap the _hamburger menu_ at the top-left to bring up the menu, then tap the _3-dots_ and choose **Storage manager**.

In Storage manager, tap the **Plus (+) button** to add a new connection.

In the _Network Connection Wizard_, choose **LAN / SMB** and tap _Next_.

You should see any SMB shares in your network under _server details_, choose one and tap **Next**.

Choose your _authentication_ method and tap **Next**. (I suggest using _Username and password_ unless you have properly configured the SMB share for guest access, otherwise you may experience permissions issues.)

If you chose _Username and password_ authentication, you'll be prompted for the login info. Enter it and tap **Next**.

On the next screen, under _Set advanced_, choose **Yes** and tap _Next_.

For _Protocol version_ choose the recommended **SMB 2**, then tap _Next_. On the next screen choose whether to use encryption (if your SMB share is encrypted) and tap _Next_.

You'll get to review your settings, if everything is correct tap **Next**.

On the following screen, tap the big **Connect** button.

![Connect button.](../../img/blog/solidexplorer11.jpg 'Connect button')

If everything is properly configured, the button will **turn green with a checkmark**. Tap _Finish_.

![Connection successful.](../../img/blog/solidexplorer12.jpg 'Connection successful')

You'll see your server under _Storage manager_. Tap the **back arrow (<-)** to go back to the menu.

You should see the SMB share among the options under _Storages_.

You're done! Now you can easily access your SMB shares from your Android device with Solid Explorer, and it even has built-in media players, image viewer and text editor.

## Transferring files via Solid Explorer

Transferring files between your Android device and SMB shares is done by using _panes_. If you swipe left and right on your phone or tablet's touchscreen, you'll switch to a different pane, and you can navigate to different directories on each pane. Navigate to an _SMB share_ on one pane, and to one of your device's _internal directories_ on the other pane.

To transfer between device and share, tap a file and hold for a moment to select it. You can tap additional files to select them as well. Then tap on the **three dots (...)** on the bottom menu, then choose _Transfer_ from the options.

![Transferring files in Solid Explorer.](../../img/blog/solidexplorer15.jpg 'Transferring files in Solid Explorer')

A pop-up will show the destination of the file transfer, tap either _Copy to..._ or _Move to..._ (which removes it from the source directory) to begin the transfer.

![Choosing to copy or move files in Solid Explorer.](../../img/blog/solidexplorer16.jpg 'Choosing to copy or move files in Solid Explorer')

You'll see a circlular progress bar on the bottom right, when the transfer is done it turns into a **green checkmark**.
