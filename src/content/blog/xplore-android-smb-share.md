description: "I've wrote before about file managers for Android before, recently I found X-plore which makes it very easy to transfer files back and forth between Android and SMB network shares, once you understand how the UI works. Here's to connect X-plore to an SMB network share so you can transfer files between devices."

## About X-plore File Manager

<a href="https://www.lonelycatgames.com/apps/xplore" target="_blank" data-umami-event="xplore-file-manager-site">X-plore File Manager by Lonely Cat Games</a> is a file manager app for Android devices that lets you connect to cloud storage and network folders including (among others) Google Drive, Dropbox, S/FTP, and for our purposes, SMB shares. By connecting X-plore to an SMB share you can easily interact with server files using a GUI and transfer files between server and device. X-plore File Manager can be <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lonelycatgames.Xplore" target="_blank" umami-event-data="xplore-file-manager-gplay">downloaded from the Google Play Store for free</a>.

## Adding SMB share in X-plorer

First, make sure you're on the same Wi-Fi network as the SMB share you want to add in X-plore. (Setting this up to be available from outside the home network is possible, but beyond the scope of this article. But <a href="/blog/comprehensive-guide-tailscale-securely-access-home-network/" target="_blank" data-umami-event="x-plore-tailscale">this might interest you.</a>)

X-plore File Manager's UI looks weird at first, but once it clicks for you it's very easy to use. When you first open it will show your internal storage.

If you swipe left from here, or click the icon to the left of the _three-dot menu (...)_, the screen will change to a second, identical screen. On this second screen, tap on **Internal shared storage** to close it, you'll see other options.

![UI of X-plore File Manager.](../../img/blog/xplore2.jpg 'UI of X-plore File Manager')

The option we want is _LAN_. Tap on it, then on **Add server**, and from the dropdown tap on **Scan**. This will show any discoverable network shares.

Click on the share you want to access, if login is required you'll get a pop-up asking for login info. Add your username and password, and click **Save**.

Now you'll be back in the list of discovered SMB shares, notice the one you just added moved to the top of the list under LAN has a _checkmark on the icon_.

## Transferring files from Android to SMB share

We will now transfer multiple files from the Android device to a network share on my server. Swipe back to the phone's internal storage, tap to a folder with files you want to transfer -- say, _DCIM_ -> _Camera_ for example.

![Accessing an internal storage folder in X-plore File Manager.](../../img/blog/xplore7.jpg 'Accessing an internal storage folder in X-plore File Manager')

To select specific files, tap the **checkmarks** next to the files. Alternately, you can tap the checkmark next to a folder to select the folder with all contents, or tap the checkmark twice to select all files inside the folder.

Once you've selected what you want to transfer, swipe back to _LAN_ storage, tap on the server and find the folder you want to transfer files into from Android -- tap the **checkmark** next to that folder.

Now swipe back to internal storage, _tap and hold_ one of the selected files to bring up a menu. Tap on **Copy**.

![File options menu in X-plore File Manager.](../../img/blog/xplore10.jpg 'File options menu in X-plore File Manager')

You'll get a final confirmation dialog, and the option to move instead of copy the files, which will delete the source files. Tap **OK**.

You'll see the files being transferred...

And then they'll be in your destination folder in the network share.

All done! Once you get a hang of the UI, transferring files back and forth from Android to remote sources is very easy.
