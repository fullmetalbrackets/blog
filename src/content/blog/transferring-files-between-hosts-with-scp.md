## Introduction

Secure Copy is a command line utility that transfers files between the local host and a remote host via the SSH protocol. You will be prompted for the remote user's password, or you can use an <a href="/blog/generating-an-ssh-key-pair/" target="_blank" data-umami-event="transfer-scp-to-generating-ssh-key-pair">authorized SSH key</a>.

## SCP Command Syntax

```bash
scp -OPTION user@SourceIP:file.txt user@DestinationIP:file.txt
```

## SCP Options

- `-r`: Recursively copy entire directories, also follows symbolic links
- `-P`: Specifies an SSH port on destination host, use if destination uses SSH port other than 22
- `-p`: Copied files keep modification times, access times, permissions and modes
- `-v`: Verbose mode; prints additional debugging messages about transfer progress
- `-q`: Quiet mode; disables the progress bar and warning/diagnostic messages
- `-C`: Compresses sent data for faster transfer speeds

## Copying files and directories to a remote host

Copy a file from local host to a remote host:

```bash
scp file.txt remote-user@192.168.1.10:/directory
```

If preferred, use hostnames instead of IP addresses:

```bash
scp file.txt remote-user@hostname:/directory
```

You can also copy a file with a different name at the destination:

```bash
scp file.txt remote-user@192.168.1.10:/directory/newfilename.txt
```

If the remote host uses a port besides the default 22 for SSH, specify it with the <em>-P</em> option:

```bash
scp -P 2222 file.txt remote-user@192.168.1.10:/directory
```

<br>
To copy a directory, you'll need to do so recursively with the <em>-r</em> option:

```bash
scp -r /directory remote-user@192.168.1.10:/directory
```

## Copying from a remote host to the local machine

To copy from the local host rather than to it, put the remote host's info first and the local host info after:

```bash
scp remote-user@192.168.1.10:/directory/file.txt /local-directory
```

## Transfer files between two remote hosts

With **SCP** its even possible to transfer between two other systems, as long as your local machine has access to both via SSH or password.

```bash
scp user@192.168.0.10:/directory/file.txt user@192.168.0.12:/directory/file.txt
```
