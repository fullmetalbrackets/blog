## Information

My daily driver desktop PC since 2015, where I interneted, gamed and worked. This thing was still trucking on Windows 10 till this year (2024) and with the stock AMD Radeon RX 480 GPU was still playing newer games like Cyberpunk 2077 very well. I removed the GPU when converting it into a server, since Plex cannot use AMD cards for transcoding (at least not well) and the integrated GPU can do Intel Sync and transcodes perfectly. I installed Debian on the M.2 NVMe drive and moved over all my HDDs from my old server, but this time they could be internal since the motherboard has 4 SATA ports.
