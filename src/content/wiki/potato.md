![Libre Sweet Potato](../../img/blog/sweet-potato.jpg)

# Libre Sweet Potato

- 32 GB USB Drive (boot drive)
- 100 Mbps Ethernet

## Services

- Pi-Hole (bare metal)
- Nginx Proxy Manager (Docker container)

## Information

Bought for a measly $30, the early access price for the Sweet Potato. (Now costs $35.) This thing only barely uses any power and runs 24/7 as the main instance of Pi-Hole on my home network.
