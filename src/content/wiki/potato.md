# Hardware

**Libre Sweet Potato**

- 32 GB USB Drive (boot drive)
- 128 GB USB Drive (extra storage & network share)
- 100 Mbps Ethernet

Bought for a measly $30. This thing only ever uses around 4 watts of power and runs 24/7 as the main instance of Pi-Hole on my home network, as well as acting as a reverse proxy. It also self-hosts yet another mirror of my blog (<a href="https://bleh.cc" target="_blank">bleh.cc</a>) that is exposed to the internet via a Cloudflare tunnel.
