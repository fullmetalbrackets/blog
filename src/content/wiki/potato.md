## Information

Bought for a measly $30, the early access price for the Sweet Potato. (Now costs $35.) Used to run my main instance of **Pi-Hole**. (Until I got a GL.iNet Flint 2 router and started running AdGuard Home on it. I still run Pi-Hole on my [Raspberry Pi](/wiki/pi/), though.) Not currently being used.
