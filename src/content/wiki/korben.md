# Hardware

**Dell Optiplex 3020 Micro**

- 120 GB 2.5" Internal HDD (boot drive)
- 2 TB 3.5" External HDD (large media storage)
- 1 TB 2.5" External HDD (documents, photos, etc.)
- 1 Gbps Ethernet

Bought on EBay for $45. It came with a small laptop-sized internal HDD (the only kind that fits) that I use as a boot drive, added a 2 TB 3.5" HDD for large media file storage and 1 TB 3.5" HDD where I store documents and photos, both connected via USB 3.0.
