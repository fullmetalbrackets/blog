# Dell Optiplex 3020 Micro

- 120 GB 2.5" Internal HDD
- 1 Gbps Ethernet
- 8 GB RAM

## Information

Bought on EBay for $45. It came with a small laptop-sized 2.5" internal HDD (the only kind that fits) that I use as a boot drive. An external USB 3.0 dock holds two 3.5" HDDs of 2 TB each for large media storage. An additional 2.5" HDD in an external enclosure holds my documents, photos, music and other data.
