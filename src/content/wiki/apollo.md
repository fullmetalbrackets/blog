# Dell Optiplex 3050 SFF\*

- 256 GB NVMe SSD (Boot drive)
- 1 TB 3.5" Internal HDD
- 1 TB 2.5" Internal HDD
- 1 Gbps Ethernet
- HDMI Port

Bought on EBay for around $160. Added a cheap, low capacity NVMe SSD to use as a boot drive, a 1 TB full-size (2.5") hard drive, and replaced the CD drive with a caddy that holds a laptop hard drive (2.5"). I originally used this as my home server, but switched over to using <a href="korben">my Dell Optiplex 3020 Micro</a> as the server, since it's lower power and all my self-hosted services still work perfectly on it. I currently use this machine as my daily driver since it has an HDMI port (the 3020 micro does not), running Debian 12 and XFCE desktop environment. It's has much lower power consumption than my Windows PC, so now I only use the Windows PC for gaming only.
