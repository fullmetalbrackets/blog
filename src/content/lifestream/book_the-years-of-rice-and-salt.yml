type: book
title: The Years of Rice and Salt
author: Kim Stanley Robinson
genre: ["alt history", "historical fiction", "fantasy"]
description: In an alternate world where the Black Death wiped out 99% of Europeans, we follow different, but connected characters throughout centuries of altered history defined by the Muslim and Chinese civilzations rising to become global empires.
note: I've always been a sucker for alternate history and this particular book is both thought-provoking and very fun to read. The author uses Buddhism and spirituality in an interesting way to connect disparate characters and historcal events over hundreds of years.
