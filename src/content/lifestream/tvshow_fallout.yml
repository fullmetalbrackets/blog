pubDate: 2026-02-05T19:30
seasons: 2
inProgress: true
note: Season 2 was not as good as the first season, but that's a hard act to follow. I still enjoyed it, it answered some questions, and they're clearly setting up some big things for the future. Need more Dogmeat, though, he was just a prop this season!
