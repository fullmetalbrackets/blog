note: "The original Metroid Prime is one of my favorite games of all time, I did not like Metroid Prime 2: Echoes as much and never even played Metroid Prime 3: Corruption. I absolutely loved Metroid Prime 4, it felt like a return to the first game's roots, with some surprising new additions -- overall beautiful and run, though fairly short for a fully priced game."
