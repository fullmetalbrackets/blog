title: A website to destroy all websites, by Henry from Online
note: Found this recently and it really spoke to me, or whatever. I've been adding more "personal" stuff to this site so it's more than just a blog with a bunch of guides on how to do things. (Although that will always remain the main focus.) I strongly suggest this insightful article about the internet and websites.
