I've now completed a playthrough for the second time. I did much better and enjoyed it even more this time around, especially playing on my new gaming PC that runs the game perfectly at max settings. (Though with Ray Tracing turned off -- the performance is terrible even at the lowest setting and there's barely a different in fidelity.)

I'll be replaying Shadow of the Erdtree soon, and this time I will beat Promised Consort Radahn!
