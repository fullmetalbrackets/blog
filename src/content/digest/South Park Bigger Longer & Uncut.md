description: The original South Park movie from 1999

I've seen this movie many times since I came out in the long, long ago of 1999. Had to do a rewatch after the latest seasons of South Park had so many callbacks to the movie.

Still a classic, and I always forget the movie is more of a musical than every South Park episode or special ever made. I feel like now is the time to make another South Park movie/special/episode that is a musical, what with musicals being all the rage now...
