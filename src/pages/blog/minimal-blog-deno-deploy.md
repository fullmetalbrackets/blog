## Install Deno

Installing Deno is quick and easy via automated script. You can alternately use various package managers <a href="https://deno.land/manual@v1.28.1/getting_started/installation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as per the Deno documentation</a>. For this guide I will use the script to install with one command:

### For Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
irm https://deno.land/install.ps1 | iex
```

### For Linux and Mac terminal:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://deno.land/x/install/install.sh | sh
```

On Linux, after Deno is installed, add the `deno` command path to the end of your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`:

```bash
export PATH="/home/username/.deno/bin:$PATH"
```

Verify successful installation with the command `deno --version`. In the future when you want to update Deno to the latest release, you can do so with the following command:

```bash
deno upgrade
```

## Create the blog from template and customize it

We'll be using the <a href="https://github.com/denoland/deno_blog" target="_blank">deno_blog boilerplate</a> to set up a very minimal, no frills blog. The creator of Deno, Ryan Dahl, uses a version of this template <a href="https://tinyclouds.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for his own blog</a>.

Open a terminal and use the following command, substituting the path at the end where your project will live locally:

```bash
$ deno run -r --allow-read --allow-write https://deno.land/x/blog/init.ts ./directory/for/blog/
```

Once the blog is set up, go into the project directory and run the development server using the command `deno task dev` and go to the URL. Notice the default layout of everything.

To configure and customize the blog, edit the `main.tsx` file. It should look like the below:

```tsx
/** @jsx h */

import blog, { ga, redirects, h } from "blog";

blog({
  title: "My Blog",
  description: "This is my new blog.",
  // header: <header>Your custom header</header>,
  // section: <section>Your custom section</section>,
  // footer: <footer>Your custom footer</footer>,
  avatar: "https://deno-avatar.deno.dev/avatar/blog.svg",
  avatarClass: "rounded-full",
  author: "An author",

  // middlewares: [

  // If you want to set up Google Analytics, paste your GA key here.
  // ga("UA-XXXXXXXX-X"),

  // If you want to provide some redirections, you can specify them here,
  // pathname specified in a key will redirect to pathname in the value.
  // redirects({
  //  "/hello_world.html": "/hello_world",
  // }),

  // ]
});
```

We'll go through this bit by bit:

- The `title` will appear in large text directly under your avatar, and `description` will appear in smaller text right under that. The `avatar` parameter takes a URL for the image to be displayed, and `avatarClass` determines the avatar's shape. Finally, `author` is self-explanatory, just use your own name here.

- The `header`, `section` and `footer` are commented out by default, but can be customized to change the default appearance of your blog. That's beyond the scope of this guide. (Mainly because I haven't messed with it too much myself.) It's safe to delete this if you will not use it.

- The commented out `middleware` and `redirects` are fairly self-explanatory, you can add a Google Analytics key and specify some redirects. Feel free to delete if you're not using them.
  <br><br>

In addition, you can add the following parameters:

- `dateStyle: "long"` displays dates in long format, for example _November 15, 2022_ (the default is short format, e.g. _2022-11-15_)
- `favicon: "favicon.ico"` lets you use a custom favicon, but be warned it only accepts `.ico` files -- unfortunately it does not support SVG favicons at this time.
- `lang: "en"` specifies the blog's language, the default is _en_ (English).
- `unocss: unocss_opts` seems to be for importing <a href="https://github.com/unocss/unocss" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Uno CSS</a> but I have not used it myself.
  <br><br>

Once you've got everything set up to your liking, you'll need to push the project to a GitHub repo for the next step.

<div id='deploy' />

## Host the blog on Deno Deploy

We'll be hosting our blog on <a href="" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deno Deploy</a>, which deploys from a GitHub repo and requires a GitHub account for login.

Once logged in to Deno Deploy, you'll be on the _Projects_ dashboard. Click the _+ New Project_ button:

<a href="/img/blog/deno2.png" target="_blank"><img src="/img/blog/deno2.png" alt="Screenshot of Deno Deploy UI"></a>

Click on _Select GitHub repository_ and you'll be taken to GitHub to login and choose a repo to deploy from.

Choose the option _Only select repositories_ then choose your blog's repo from the _Select repositories_ dropdown menu. Click _Save_ to confirm and be taken back to Deno Deploy. Now again click on _Select GitHub repository_, then on your GitHub username, then on the blog repo from the list.

Next click on _Select production branch_ and your main/master branch should be the default choice -- click it then click on _Automatic_ since we don't require a build step, then it should detect that `main.tsx` is the entry point, so click it. Next type in a project name, which will be the sub-directory of your project, for example: `https://my-blog.deno.dev`. Finally, click the _Link_ button to pull your code from the GitHub repo and publish to Deno Deploy. After a few minutes your blog should be up and running!

<div id='domain' />

## Use your own custom domain

Deno Deploy lets you easily use a custom domain you own instead of `https://project.deno.dev`. From the dashboard click on your project, then click on the _Settings_ tab. Scroll down to _Domains_ and click _+ Add Domain_, type in your custom domain, then click _Save_. Next click on the _Setup_ button next to your newly added domain, copy and paste the DNS records into your domain registrar's DNS settings, then after a few minutes click the _Validate_ button.

If it says "Validation has failed" just wait a little while longer then try again. Once validation is successful, you'll be able to provision an SSL certificate.

Click on _Get automatic certificates_ to finish. (Or upload your own certificate, if you prefer and know what you're doing.) After a few moments you should see your domain now has a green checkmark on it.

<a href="/img/blog/deno5.png" target="_blank"><img src="/img/blog/deno5.png" alt="Screenshot of Deno Deploy project DNS"></a>

You should now be able to go to your custom domain to reach your blog. For whatever reason, in my experience it seems to load much faster on a custom top-level domain compared to Deno Deploy's `deno.dev` sub-domain. Enjoy!
