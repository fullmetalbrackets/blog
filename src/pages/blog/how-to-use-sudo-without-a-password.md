Removing the sudo password prompt is done by editing the `/etc/sudoers` file, however you should never edit this file directly, but instead use `sudo visudo` to do so.

The file will look something like this:

```bash
# User privilege specification
root    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

# Members of the admin group may gain root privileges
%admin  ALL=(ALL) ALL

# Allow members of group sudo to execute any command
%sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
```

There's two ways to disable the password prompt.

1. Disable it only for a specific user
2. Disable it for all users in the sudo group

## Disable password prompt for a specific user

Add the following line to `/etc/sudoers` file:

```bash
user    ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
```

## Disable password prompt for all sudoers

Edit the `%sudo` line in `/etc/sudoers` file:

```bash
%sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
```

## Check syntax of /etc/sudoers

It's best to check and make sure you're not breaking anything. Use the following command:

```bash
visudo -c
```

You'll get output letting you know whether or not the file syntax is correct.

```bash
‚ùØ sudo visudo -c
/etc/sudoers: parsed OK
/etc/sudoers.d/README: parsed OK
```
