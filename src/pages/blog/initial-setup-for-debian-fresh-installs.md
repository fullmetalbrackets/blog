Debian is pretty minimal, however, so I need a reminder of those extra steps that are necessary on a fresh install of Debian."

## Installing and configuring sudo

The almighty `sudo` command is not even available in Debian by default -- instead you have to switch to the root user to do things that require administrative privileges. So first thing I always do is get it installed.

```bash
apt install sudo -y
```

Once installed, add a user to the sudo group:

```bash
adduser user sudo
```

Now switch to the user that was just added to the sudo group, and verify the user is authorized:

```bash
sudo -v
```

> _Note:_ The rest of this guide will assume you are still the `root` user when performing the following actions, if you are instead using your new superuser, you will need to append `sudo` for some commands.

## Set a static IP address

Debian's non-graphical install does not give you the option to set a static IP, so let's do it manually. First, save a copy of the default network config as a back up.

```bash
cp /etc/network/interfaces /backups/
```

Now edit the file:

```bash
nano /etc/network/interfaces
```

Look for these lines towards the end of the file:

```conf
# The primary network interface
allow-hotplug enp0s25
iface enp0s25 inet dhcp
```

Edit to the following:

```conf
# The primary network interface
auto enp0s25
iface enp0s25 inet static
 address 192.168.1.250
 netmask 255.255.255.0
 gateway 192.168.1.254
 dns-nameservers 1.1.1.1 8.8.8.8
```

Save and close the file, then restart the networking service and check it's status:

```bash
systemctl restart networking.service
systemctl status networking.service
```

> _Note:_ If you get an error, you probably have to run `systemctl restart NetworkManager.service` or `systemctl restart network-manager` instead.

If there's no errors, the output should look something like this:

```bash
‚óè networking.service - Raise network interfaces
     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/networking.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
     Active: active (exited) since Wed 2022-10-05 16:44:08 EDT; 2h 5min ago
       Docs: man:interfaces(5)
   Main PID: 490 (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)
      Tasks: 0 (limit: 1112)
     Memory: 0B
        CPU: 0
     CGroup: /system.slice/networking.service
```

Also check your IP address:

```bash
ip -c addr show enp0s25
```

Output should look similar to this:

```bash
2: enp0s25: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UP group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 70:5a:b6:ac:52:d6 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 192.168.0.250/24 brd 192.168.0.255 scope global enp0s25
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 fe80::725a:b6ff:feac:52d6/64 scope link
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
```
