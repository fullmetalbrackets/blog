# Adding the Yarn repository

Use this command to add the Yarn repository and signing key:

```bash
echo "deb https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/ stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yarn.list
```

Now update the package list and install as normal:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install yarn
```

The above command will install NodeJS along with Yarn. If you only want to install Yarn without NodeJS, maybe because you already installed it separately, use this command instead:

```bash
sudo apt install --no-install-recommends yarn
```

Once done, verify installation by checking the version:

```bash
‚ùØ yarn --version
1.22.19
```
