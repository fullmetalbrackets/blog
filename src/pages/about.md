This is my personal website, made with [Astro](https://astro.build) as a way to learn the framework. This site's design and code is open source, so feel free to [check it out](https://github.com/fullmetalbrackets/blog). Eventually this site will have a portfolio of projects I've worked on, but for now feel free to read my blog -- really just a dump of documentation I've made for myself as I've learned web development, Linux, the command line, etc. Thanks for visiting!

More to come...
