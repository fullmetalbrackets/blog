This is my personal blog consisting mostly of instructions, quick guides and other documentation I've written up for myself. The site is made with <a href="https://astro.build" target="_blank">Astro 1.0</a> as a way to learn the framework, and frankly so far it was super easy to make and is super easy to maintain.

This site's design and code is open source, so feel free to <a href="https://github.com/fullmetalbrackets/blog" target="_blank">check it out</a>. Eventually this site will have a portfolio of projects I've worked on, but for now feel free to read my blog -- really just a dump of documentation I've made for myself as I've learned web development, Linux, the command line, etc. Thanks for visiting!

More to come...
