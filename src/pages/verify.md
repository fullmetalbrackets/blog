## WTF is a Verify slashpage?

This is a [concept pioneered by Molly White](https://www.mollywhite.net/verify/) (creator of the very accurate [Web3 is Going Just Great blog](https://www.web3isgoinggreat.com/)) for a page that verifies your identity across the internet. Or for a concise summary:

> A <span class="i b u em">verify slashpage</span> is a specific web page, typically found at the URL path `yourwebsite.com`, that is used to establish the authenticity of associated social media accounts or other online profiles. [...]
